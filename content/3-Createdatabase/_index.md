### Overview
In this step, we will create databases with RDS, will a replica. We will also implement ElasticCache to provide caching for the database.

### Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
**Amazon RDS** is a managed database service that helps you quickly create relational databases and automates backups and failovers so you don't have to wake up in the middle of the night to bring a database back up.

### Amazon ElasticCache
**Amazon ElasticCache** is an in-memory caching that provides microsecond read and write latency. ElastiCache is compatible with **Redis** and **Memcached**. We are going to be using **Redis** with ElasticCache.
